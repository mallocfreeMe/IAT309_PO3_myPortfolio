                        <p>There are problems to be solved all around us. Common, everyday occurrences that have been so
                            integrated into our daily lives that we hardly notice the trouble they cause or think to
                            seek a
                            solution for them.</p>
                        <p>If you were to stop a person on the street and ask about the specifics of their wardrobe,
                            it’s
                            unlikely they could answer anything but the most basic of questions. It is also very
                            possible
                            that they have forgotten about a lot of items they own. This can lead to the purchase of new
                            items without realizing just how many items are in the back of their closet, hardly worn.

                    <p>Here is an example of how we would imagine this application being incorporated into a user’s
                        daily routin.</p>

                    <h3>At home:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>X wakes up and launches the app.</li>
                        <li>X sees an auto suggested outfit.</li>
                        <li>X decides they like the
                            pants but does not feel like wearing that shirt today.</li>
                        <li>X swipes right to browse through tops.</li>
                        <li>X long presses on the shirt card to pull up filters</li>
                        <li>selects ‘blue’ + ‘t-shirt’ + ‘work’ in order to filter for appropriate items.</li>
                        <li>X is presented
                            with options and makes their decision by adding the item to their outfit.</li>
                        <li>X confirms the outfit
                            for the day.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>In Store</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>X is shopping in their favorite store.</li>
                        <li>X finds a shirt they really like.</li>
                        <li>X thinks there
                            is a chance that they already have a Black V-Neck T-Shirt.</li>
                        <li>X launches the app, and clicks on the
                            t-shirt database.</li>
                        <li>X searches filters like ‘black’ + ‘t-shirt’ → X sees that they do have a black t-shirt but
                            it is not a v-neck.</li>
                        <li>X makes the decision on whether they would like to
                            purchase the item based on the given info.</li>

                    <h2>My role</h2>
                    <p>Closet Buddy is a five-person project, and I am responsible for making all the prototyping. At
                        the beginning stage of the project, I participated in the ideation of the design. In wave 2 of
                        the project, I started to make basic prototyping for my team to do user testings. In the last
                        wave of the project, I modified the prototypes based on the feedback I received from my team
                        members and user testing forms.</p>

                    <h2>Wave 1</h2>
                    <p>To begin the design process, we started by analyzing the problem space. Early on we began
                        analyzing other existing applications that offer similar services. Considering that we want to
                        create a robust and intuitive user interface, we analyzed different the different UI’s and made
                        observations about the user experience.</p>
