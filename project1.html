                        <p>There are problems to be solved all around us. Common, everyday occurrences that have been so
                            integrated into our daily lives that we hardly notice the trouble they cause or think to
                            seek a
                            solution for them.</p>
                        <p>If you were to stop a person on the street and ask about the specifics of their wardrobe,
                            it’s
                            unlikely they could answer anything but the most basic of questions. It is also very
                            possible
                            that they have forgotten about a lot of items they own. This can lead to the purchase of new
                            items without realizing just how many items are in the back of their closet, hardly worn.

                        <li>X swipes right to browse through tops.</li>
                        <li>X long presses on the shirt card to pull up filters</li>
                        <li>selects ‘blue’ + ‘t-shirt’ + ‘work’ in order to filter for appropriate items.</li>
                        <li>X is presented
                            with options and makes their decision by adding the item to their outfit.</li>
                        <li>X confirms the outfit

                        <li>X launches the app, and clicks on the

                    <h2>My role</h2>
                    <p>Closet Buddy is a five-person project, and I am responsible for making all the prototyping. At
                        the beginning stage of the project, I participated in the ideation of the design. In wave 2 of
                        the project, I started to make basic prototyping for my team to do user testings. In the last
                        wave of the project, I modified the prototypes based on the feedback I received from my team
                        members and user testing forms.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="wave1">
                    <h2>Wave 1</h2>
                    <p>To begin the design process, we started by analyzing the problem space. Early on we began
                        analyzing other existing applications that offer similar services. Considering that we want to
                        create a robust and intuitive user interface, we analyzed the difference from different UI’s and
                        made
                        observations about the user experience.</p>

                    <div class="case1">
                        <img src="img/project1/cases/1.png" alt="case 1 study image">
                        <p>
                            YourCloset (<a href="https://www.yourclosetapp.com/"
                                target="_blank">https://www.yourclosetapp.com/</a>) is one
                            of the simpler applications we’ve analyzed.
                            The UI is plain and has a generic layout, so if the user has several apps on their phone
                            they
                            wouldn’t have any issues with this. Our main issue with YourCloset is how limited the users
                            are
                            when it comes to the onboarding process. Users can only input clothes into the app via the
                            camera, which can be cumbersome for larger wardrobes. For that reason, we hope to include a
                            variety of options so that users can decide to onboard items in whatever way they find
                            easiest.
                            Some might choose to use their camera in order to get the most accurate image of their item
                            while others might choose to just search up the item as it appears in the online store.

                            GetWardrobe (<a href="https://en.getwardrobe.com/"
                                target="_blank">https://en.getwardrobe.com/</a>) is a visually better application. It
                            does a
                            lot of
                            things better than most other applications we’ve reviewed, specifically the number of
                            options
                            users have when it comes to choosing and sorting through their wardrobe. In fact, it gives
                            the
                            users too many filters to apply to their wardrobe which ends up increasing the amount of
                            mental
                            effort that the user would have to exert. Our strategy is to create an informed UI that we
                            help
                            users navigate options easier. Overall, the main features we want to focus on are giving
                            users
                            multiple ways of cataloguing their wardrobe, a calendar feature that users can integrate
                            into
                            other calendars and a feature that provides recommendations based on weather, location, etc.
                            Another design choice we’ve chosen is to make and visually build the app to be gender
                            neutral as
                            most of the apps we’ve seen are catered exclusively to women. We want to build a general
                            lifestyle application.

                            Furthermore, we must consider the limitations of human cognition. For example, we are only
                            able
                            to focus on a select amount of items at a time and attention can shift very quickly. For
                            this
                            reason, we must consider which information is the most important at any given stage. We will
                            attempt to create a simple interface to avoid visual cluttering. Next, our whole system is
                            based
                            on offloading human memory. As we have learned, users can recognize much easier than they
                            can
                            recall. This is why we have moved the wardrobe to a virtual representation so that they do
                            not
                            have to recall their wardrobe when they are in a store. Since one of our problems is that we
                            tend to forget certain items of clothing, the app will store and potentially offer all items
                            in
                            the hopes of avoiding lost clothing.

                    </div>

                    <p>Finally, we began a user survey. This will be sent out with the goal of understanding how a user
                        functions on a given day, how they feel about the current state of their wardrobe and what
                        features they would consider to be necessary or not.</p>

                    <h2>Wave 2</h2>
                    <p>For this iteration, we all began by making sure we all understood the app and its core
                        functionality. Next, we were tasked with creating a paper prototype each. We felt that this
                        would be a good way to flush out ideas, since we all might have a slightly different vision in
                        our heads. Finally, we split up the digital prototype and the report. David
                        analyzed everyone’s paper prototypes and combined them into an initial digital prototype.
                        Rollin, Nikhil, Ruby and Sara began looking into methods we could use to prepare our digital
                        prototype
                        for user testing. After the first version of the digital prototype was created, we went through
                        a group
                        walkthrough and discussion to make sure that the user journey made sense. When we were all happy
                        with it, David implemented the new ideas and Rollin and Sara worked on the
                        report.

                    <p>As a team, we learned to start user testing earlier in the future. We may have made a lot of
                        assumptions on
                        features we felt were obvious or ones we felt were important. User testing showed us where we
                        need to pay more attention, and where we need to pay less. During this stage we also learned
                        that it is necessary to make some tough decisions, as with the number of items to display.
                        However, in the end, it is our job to make these calls so that our users can have the best
                        experience possible.</p>
